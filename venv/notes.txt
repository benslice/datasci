Question is whether I install into a virtual ENV or not. It is already somewhat containerized, the 
whole thing is on a VM. 


Currently I have lots of stuff installed globally via pacman. If I activate the 
environment, all of these packges don't show up when I run pip. _However, I can 
activate them_. FALSE, I called ipython, which was not installed in the virtual 
env, so it spun up the global copy, which _can_ import the global packages.


### virtualenv Pros:
  1. isolate dependancies
  2. may ease cloud deployment
  
### virtualenv Cons:
  1. Increased complexity
  2. not sure lab knows HOW to run in a venv
  3. Could use pacman instead (this is inherently less portable)
  
  
Summary, I think that I will _not_ use virtual envs yet. The pros are all theoretical, and the cons
are not. I'm not even up to one project yet, and the choice of manjaro should ease the problems that
I saw with arch because it is not rolling / constantly updating. Also, the whole point of Jupyter 
lab is remote access. So portability is really less of an issue than it was before.

I think I'll install everything that I can using pacman, and pip for everything else. I would like
a tool that iterates through packages and lets me know which belong to pip, and which to pacman.
(pip will list both). Also, can I prevent pip from trying to update packages that belong to pacman
